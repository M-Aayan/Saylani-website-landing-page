# Saylani-website-landing-page

The Saylani Website Landing Page is a static webpage designed to represent the front-facing layout of the Saylani Welfare organization. Built exclusively with HTML and CSS, it provides a professional and visually appealing interface tailored to showcase Saylani’s mission, services, and initiatives. It is non-responsive, meaning the layout is optimized for a fixed screen size, typically for desktop users.

How It Works
Page Layout:
The landing page is structured into multiple sections that deliver essential content to the users:

Header Section: Contains the logo and navigation menu to provide easy access to different areas of the site.

Hero/Banner Section: Features a prominent visual element, such as a large image or background banner, accompanied by a heading, subheading, and a call-to-action button to grab attention.

About Section: Highlights the organization's mission, goals, and a brief description of its impact.

Services Section: Lists the primary services provided by Saylani Welfare, such as education, healthcare, and food distribution, often displayed in a grid or card layout.

Footer Section: Includes essential contact information, links to social media platforms, and copyright details.


Styling and Visual Appeal:

Color Palette: The design uses Saylani's official colors (e.g., green, white, and blue) to align with the organization's branding.

Typography: Fonts are chosen to ensure readability and consistency with Saylani's identity.

Hover Effects: Buttons and links incorporate hover states for interactivity, providing visual feedback to users.

Static Images: Relevant images, icons, and banners are used to visually communicate Saylani’s initiatives.


Static Layout:

The design uses fixed widths and heights for elements, ensuring the layout looks good on specific screen sizes.

Elements are positioned using CSS techniques such as margins, padding, and alignment to create a visually balanced and structured interface.


How It Was Made

HTML for Structure:

The landing page is built using semantic HTML5 tags like <header>, <section>, and <footer> to define the different areas of the webpage.

Each section contains headings, paragraphs, and images to convey relevant information.


CSS for Styling:

Header Styling: The header is styled to include a horizontal navigation bar with links and a logo aligned neatly.

Hero Section: A large background image or gradient is applied to create a visually appealing banner. Text and buttons are overlaid using CSS positioning.

Services Section: A grid or flexbox layout is used to neatly arrange service descriptions, icons, or images.

Footer Design: Styled with a darker background color to distinguish it from other sections, containing links and contact details with proper spacing.


Design Features:

Spacing and Alignment: CSS properties like margin, padding, and text-align are used to achieve a professional and neat appearance.

Buttons and Links: Styled with rounded corners, contrasting colors, and hover effects for enhanced usability.

Static Layout: CSS properties such as width, height, and float (or flexbox) are used to structure the layout for desktop screens.


Static Nature:

Since the page is non-responsive, it works well on a fixed screen size without adapting dynamically to smaller devices.

The layout and elements remain in their designated positions regardless of screen resizing.
